If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your Personal Data (as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation).

- Legal Basis for Processing. If you are in the EEA, when we process your Personal Data we will only do so in the following situations:

  - We need to use your Personal Data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing the Services you have requested).

  - We have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Data. For example, we may process your Personal Data to send you marketing communications, to communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.

  - We have your consent to process your Personal Data. For example, when you provide us with consent to send emails to you containing information about our products and services, our affiliated or partner entities, or other industry or business news.

  - We have a legal obligation to process your Personal Data. For example, we may need to retain certain transactional data to comply with our legal obligations. We may also be required to retain information about our interactions with you when you make certain requests for information to comply with our regulatory obligations.

- Data Subject Requests and Rights.

  - If you are in the EEA, you have the right to access or modify Personal Data we hold about you and to ask that your Personal Data be corrected, erased, or transferred. The right to transfer your Personal Data or the right to data portability means that you can request that we provide certain Personal Data about you that we process in a machine-readable format. The right to erasure means that you can request deletion or removal of certain Personal Data we process about you.

  - You also have the right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process Personal Data about you, the right to be informed about the Personal Data we collect and/or process about you, the right to know with whom we have shared Personal Data about you, for what purposes, and what Personal Data has been shared (including whether Personal Data was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes), and where processing of Personal Data about you is based on consent, the right to withdraw your consent to such processing. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us at our contact email address shown below and include in the subject line the nature of your request.

Note that we may need to request additional information from you to validate a request relating to the exercise of any of the rights above.

- How We Store Your Personal Data

Your information is securely stored in the United States. You understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States or our offices in other countries. We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

- Questions or Complaints.

If you are in the EEA and have a concern about our processing of Personal Data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data privacy authority. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.

#### California

If you are a California resident, please note that we do not share information that identifies you personally with non-affiliated third parties for their own marketing use without your permission. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), California residents have the right to know and request access to their Personal Information (as defined under the CCPA) collected and shared within the past 12 months, the right to delete their Personal Information in accordance with the CCPA, the right opt out of selling, and the right not to be discriminated against if invoking these rights granted by the CCPA.

- Submitting CCPA Requests

If you are a California resident and a consumer of the website and our services, you can submit a request by contacting us at the following email address: info@metronome.io. For requests that require identity verification, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity, including asking you to provide us with information to confirm your identity using the information we have on file. If you wish to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please indicate that when submitting your request. We will make good faith efforts to respond to your request. There may be circumstances under the CCPA in which we cannot, or need not, respond to your request. Any requests that can be processed by us will be done so in no more than 45 days from the date we receive your request, unless the law requires a faster response or we notify you that an extension is required. In case of an extended completion period, we will process your request in no more than 90 days from the date of your original request. Consumers are limited to two requests to know/access their personal information within a 12-month period.
