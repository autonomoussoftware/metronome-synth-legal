## Terms of Service

Welcome to https://metronome.io and/or app.metronome.io , our website-hosted user interfaces
(each the “Interface” or “App”) provided by Autonomous Software. (“we”, “our”, or “us”). The
Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that allows
users to access certain smart contracts in a protocol (the “Protocol”) which allows them to create
synthetic digital assets and deploy them to third-party web protocols.
This Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) explains the terms and conditions by which
you may access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or
using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this
Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the
Interface.

the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties
or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may
exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, released,
and eliminated, and waived by you. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that
we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

### 9. Compliance Obligations

The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in all jurisdictions. By accessing or
using the Interface, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all
laws and regulations that may apply to you, including, but not limited to, the Commodity
Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated
thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). You may not use the
Interface if you are a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that is subject to
economic sanctions by the United States, or if your use of the Interface would be illegal or
otherwise violate any applicable law. You shall be responsible for payment of all applicable
taxes, if any, to which you might be subject through use of the Interface or the Protocol and any
and all other taxes which may apply to you.

### 10. Assumption of Risk

By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you understand the inherent risks
associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working
knowledge of the usage, intricacies and difficulties of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether
(ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20),
as well as smart contract based tokens and blockchain based software systems.
You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors
including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further
acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are
supplied to the Protocol.
If you deposit digital assets to the Protocol in connection with the creation synthetic digital
assets, you will have to supply digital assets of your own which will be used indirectly as
collateral. If such collateral declines in value such that it is no longer sufficient to secure the
amount of synthetic digital asset which were created, the Protocol may seize such collateral in a
liquidation event.
Use of the Protocol involves the use of the Ethereum Blockchain, which may require that you
pay a fee, commonly known as “Ethereum Gas Charges,” for the computational resources
required to perform a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that
we have no control over: (a) any Ethereum Blockchain transactions; (b) the method of payment
of any Ethereum Gas Charges; or (c) any actual payments of Ethereum Gas Charges.
Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of Ether stored at your
Ethereum Address to complete any transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain before initiating
such Ethereum Blockchain transaction.
You represent and warrant that you have the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional
advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable
compliance requirements under Applicable Law of engaging in transactions through the
Protocol.
You acknowledge and understand that if you allocate synthetic digital assets you create to third-
party decentralized web protocols (including DEXes) for various purposes including to facilitate
your lending, borrowing or trading through these third-party protocols and that we are not
responsible or liable for these transactions or the operation of these third-party protocols.
In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks is open source such that anyone can
use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree (i) that
neither we or any related entities are responsible for operation of the underlying software and
networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software
and networks; and (ii) that the Protocol could be subject to sudden changes in operating rules
(known as “Forks”), and that such Forks may materially affect the Protocol. It might be
discretionarily decided not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You
acknowledge and agree that we and any related entities assume absolutely no responsibility
whatsoever in respect of the Protocol, whether Forked or not.
The Protocol and any synthetic digital assets created using the Protocol could be impacted by
one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability to
continue to develop the Protocol, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the
Protocol or Ethereum blockchain, including access to your collateral or any synthetic digital
assets you may create using the Protocol.
You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code
cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks
to cryptocurrencies, the Protocol and any synthetic digital assets you create, which could result in
the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent possible, it is intended to
update the Protocol to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional
security measures, but this does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the
Metronome ecosystem or the Protocol. By using the Protocol, you acknowledge these inherent
risks.
You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated currencies or
tokens, including MET, are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to
adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of
transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any
activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent
that neither we nor any related entity or person can be held liable for such fluctuations or
increased costs.
You acknowledge that the Protocol could be subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are
solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Protocol. This warning and others
later provided by us in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert you to all of the
potential risks of utilizing the Protocol.
Although it is intended to provide accurate and timely information on the Interface and other
tools making up the Protocol, the Interface or relevant tools may not always be entirely accurate,
complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. In an
effort to continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible,
information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including without
limitation information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information
before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Interface or relevant
tools are your sole responsibility and we and our related entities shall have no liability for such
decisions. Links to third-party materials (including without limitation websites) may be
provided as a convenience but are not controlled by us. You acknowledge and agree that we are
not responsible for any aspect of the information, content, or services contained in any third-
party materials or on any third party sites accessible or linked to the Interface or available via
other relevant tools.
Any use or interaction with the Protocol requires a comprehensive understanding of applied
cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks, including those listed
above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills.
You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not
own the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
accessing or using the Interface or the Protocol. We are not responsible for operation of the
Protocol or any underlying protocols which the Protocol links to, and we make no guarantee of
their functionality, security, or availability. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume
full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface and interacting with the
Protocol.

### 11. Third-Party Resources and Promotions

The Interface may contain references or links to third-party resources, including (but not limited
to) information, materials, products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third
parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of the Interface. We do not endorse
or assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions. If you access any such
resources or participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand
that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You
expressly relieve us of and release us from any and all liability arising from your use of any such
resources or participation in any such promotions and waive any rights to make any such claims.
You acknowledge that the Interface and the Protocol link to certain open-source components and
that your use of the Interface and the Protocol is subject to, and you will comply with any,
applicable open-source licenses that govern any such open-source components (collectively,
“Open-Source Licenses”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not: (a)
resell, lease, lend, share, distribute or otherwise permit any third party to use the Interface; (b)
use the Interface for time-sharing or service bureau purposes; or (c) otherwise use the Interface
or Protocol in a manner that violates any license hereunder or any other Open-Source Licenses.

### 12. Release of Claims

Interface and your interaction with the Protocol. You further expressly waive and release us from
any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to
your use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol. If you are a California resident,
you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “[a]
general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or
suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him
or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

### 13. Indemnity

You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors,
employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries (and any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, contractors, or agents) from and against all claims, damages, obligations,
losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use of the Interface; (b)
your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any
other applicable law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party’s access and use of the Interface
with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control.

### 14. Termination or Suspension

We may terminate or suspend all or part of the Protocol as well as the Interface access
immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Protocol and Interface will
immediately cease.

### 15. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents,
affiliates, or subsidiaries (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, or
agents) be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or
exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use,
data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to any access or use of the Interface,
nor will we or they be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the information contained
within it. We assume no liability or responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of
content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any
access or use of the Interface; (c) unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in
our control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of

officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries (or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, or agents) be liable to you for any claims,
proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount
you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Interface, or $100.00, whichever is
greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on
contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of
the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of
the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This limitation
of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 16. Dispute Resolution

We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith
negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
hello-met@metronome.io so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute
resolution. If we aren’t able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then
you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.
Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Interface, this Agreement, or any other
acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited to)
any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (“Dispute”), shall be finally and exclusively settled
by arbitration under the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures. You understand that
you are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held on a
confidential basis before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to JAMS rules. The
arbitration will be held in Chicago, Illinois, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere.
Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any
other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Any claim of yours arising out of or related to these Terms, the Interface
or the Protocol must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is
permanently barred, which means that you will not have the right to assert the claim.

### 17. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver

You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff
in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or
other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration. You and we both
agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.

### 18. Governing Law

You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws,
govern this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us. You further agree that the Interface
shall be deemed to be based solely in the State of Delaware solely for the purposes of this choice
of law provision, and that although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its
availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the
State of Delaware. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by
the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that Chicago, Illinois is the proper forum for any appeals
of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement’s binding
arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.
